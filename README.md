#  BIN&DEC Converter

This is a simple application written with purpose of being little more complicated "Hello World" example (for me at least) in C and WinAPI. It's simple BIN to DEC and vice versa converter with GUI using pure Windows API.

## Building
I was using MinGW-w64 to build it so instructions are for MinGW but Visual Studio should compile this as well.

### Install Mingw-w64
Instructions on project page:
https://mingw-w64.org/doku.php

### Compile application

Go to the src directory and use `gmake`/`make`/`mingw32-make`.

```
gmake [all/clean]
```
